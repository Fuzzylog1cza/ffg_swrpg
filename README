An Index and Tool site for the Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars RPG Systems
=============================================================================

A Django implementation of the structures of the RPG system.  Initially 
conceived as an Indexing tool to Items/Weapons/Ships/Etc from the source
books of the system.  Hopefully it will someday be much more, a Character
Generator, Ship Generator, etc.

Original concept and design: Jake Di Toro <karrde@viluppo.net>

Live implementation can be found at:
